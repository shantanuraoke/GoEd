This project has three primary goals - To keep your personal devices secure and safe at all times by creating a virtual vault; 
To receive alerts whenever a device goes out of your virtual vault; 
To be able to request help from other parent networks to locate your missing device, 
thus giving the owner an approximate physical space to look out for the lost device. 
This idea incorporates low power micro controllers communicating securely with a parent microprocessor 
regularly over a local private network. The parent node will have the capability to communicate 
with other parent modules over the internet, in case of an emergency.
